# geoquiz
Application tests knowledge of geography - when users presses `True` or `False`, it provides instant feedback.
Furthermore, it allows to see the answer before pressing answer button via `Cheat` button and displays Toast if user
cheated.

FIXME: App displays `cheater` toast if cheated - affects every question
